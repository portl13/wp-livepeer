BUILD: Initial, Not yet functional

LivePeer provides an API that allows anyone in the world to go live, using a network of idle Resources in a marketplace that provides a cost effective way for video to be transcoded. This plugin allows anyone with a Livepeer account to enter in their API credentials and be able to use a tool such as OBS to go live on their own Wordpress website by dropping in a shortcode. There is a free tier of LivePeer, but be aware you may incur some costs to broadcast your stream! We hope this is helpful for you.
